This is a repository on some of my most memorable university projects, implemented in Python between 2023 and 2025. The subjects involve stochastic modelling and data science. 

- Decision tree for predicting bank branch closures using data from the US FDIC
- Use of Scikit-Learn for regression and classification with the MNIST dataset
- Implementation of Monte Carlo methods (MCMC) for probability density estimation
- Creation of an SIR model for an epidemiology project using Public Health France data on COVID-19
